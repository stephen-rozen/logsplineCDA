Description: Implements the core helper functions used in Rozen and Canales
    (2025) 'A Logspline-Based Approach for Analyzing Left-Censored
    Concentration Data'. Includes logspline-based moment estimation (Spline)
    and logspline-based robust imputation (rSpline), plus common alternatives
    for left-censored (LOD) data such as regression on order statistics (ROS),
    maximum likelihood estimation (MLE, bcMLE, rMLE), Kaplan-Meier (KM), and
    several substitution methods.
